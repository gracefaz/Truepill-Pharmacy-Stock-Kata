# Truepill Pharmacy Stock Kata

This repository contains one file (pharmacystockkata.js) which is my solution to the take-home coding test for Truepill, written in JavaScript.

## Installation

To run the program, download the single pharmacystockkata.js file and run in Visual Studio Code (VSC).

## Usage

The Truepill test has two main parts: **1.1 Medication Available in the Pharmacy**, and **1.2 Medication Inventory**. 

**1.1** requires us to maintain a list of medicines in the formulary (formulary meaning list of medicines). 

**1.2** requires us to add medicines to the inventory so that we can maintain stock levels of medicines in the formulary.
