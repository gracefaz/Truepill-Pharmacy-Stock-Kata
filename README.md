# Truepill Pharmacy Stock Kata

This repository contains my solution (pharmacystockkata.js) to the take-home coding test for Truepill, written in JavaScript. 

## Installation

The code is run within the Node.js environment. Type the following commands in the terminal:
```bash
npm install
```
```bash
npm start
````

## Description

The test consists of two main parts: **1.1 Medication Available in the Pharmacy**, and **1.2 Medication Inventory**. 

**1.1** Requires us to maintain a list of medications in the formulary (formulary meaning list of available medications). To do this I first created separate objects for each of the relevant medications from the provided data. For example,
```javascript
const paracetamol = {
  name: "Paracetamol",
  strength: "500mg",
  packSize: 50,
  totalPacks: 100,
};
```
Then I created a simple function called addToFormulary, which takes the name of one of the objects (see the paracetamol declared above) as its argument. The function checks whether the argument already exists in the formulary. If it doesn't, then the medication is added to the formulary. If the formulary already contains the medication then an error message is outputted, as a single medication can only be added to the formulary once. The function can be called by the following.
```javascript
addToFormulary(paracetamol.name);
```
After adding Paracetamol and Ibuprofen to the formulary, the formulary is printed to the console by
```javascript
console.log(formulary);
```
The same command can be used after adding more medications to check the updated formulary.


**1.2** Requires us to add medicatioins to the inventory so that we can maintain stock levels of medications in the formulary.

I chose to use a switch statement for this task, starting with declaring the 'medication' variable in the following way.
```javascript
let medication = 'Paracetamol';
```
Then we simply need to change the cases to the different medication names. For example
```javascript
switch (medication) {
  case "Paracetamol":
    if (formulary.includes("Paracetamol")) {
      console.log(
        `Name: ${paracetamol.name}, Strength: ${paracetamol.strength}, Pack Size: ${paracetamol.packSize}, Total Packs: ${paracetamol.totalPacks}`
      );
    } else {
      console.log(
        "Error! Paracetamol cannot be added to the inventory as it is not in the formulary."
      );
    }
  };
```

Something to note about this section is that only medications that are in the formulary can be added to the inventory. We were instructed to add Warfarin to the inventory, however as it is not in the formulary it cannot be added. I managed this by adding multiple if statements to the switch statement which check whether the name of the medication (for example 'Ibuprofen') is in the formulary. If yes, then the name of the medication is printed in the inventory, as expected. If the medication is not in the formulary, then the inventory prints without said medication. An error message is also printed to tell the user that the medication cannot be added to the inventory.

## Time Spent

Approximately 6 hours spent on this task.
